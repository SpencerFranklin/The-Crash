Running the game: To run the game, go to my portfolio website, under the games tab, and click the download link for The Crash
http://spencerfranklin.wixsite.com/portfolio

To run this game, unzip the zip file. From there, open the main folder named TheCrash. Next, open the Debug folder. Inside there is an exe file named TheCrash.exe. Running this will launch the game.

The code can be viewed if you are again inside the main folder named TheCrash. Then, open the next folder also named TheCrash. Inside are all the header and source files for my game.

If you have visual studios, you can open the .sln file to view the project in its entirety.

The Crash tells the story of mankind's first encounter with alien life. Let the story unfold as you investigate the sunken alien ship and solve the puzzles laid out for you.
